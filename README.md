2 Product Description

The purpose of this product is to provide a comprehensive platform for recipe management, making it
easier for users to organize their recipes, access them from any device, and discover new ones from a vast
collection of recipes. The objectives of this product are to streamline the recipe management process,
save time and eﬀort in meal planning, and improve the cooking experience for users.

Our product is an application coded in Java, making it compatible with various operating systems. It
will provide users with a user-friendly interface that allows them to store, categorize, and search their
recipes eﬃciently. Additionally, users will be able to explore new recipes from an extensive database,
save their favorites, and create customized shopping lists based on the ingredients required for selected
recipes. Users will also be able to ﬁlter recipes suitable with their diet (vegan, meat, dairy, etc..), stick
with their diet better with the meal planner option, or provided with precisely convenient calculations in
portion setting with the exact amount of ingredients (gram, cups, etc..) in both shopping and cooking
process.

The problem that our product aims to solve is the hassle of organizing and managing a collection of recipes.
Many people ﬁnd it challenging to keep track of their recipes, which often results in lost or misplaced
recipes, diﬃculty in meal planning, and ineﬃciency in grocery shopping. Our recipe management system
will provide users with a one-stop-shop for all their recipe needs, allowing them to access their recipes
from any device, search for new recipes, and create a shopping list based on the ingredients required.

Overall, our recipe management system will provide an eﬃcient solution for recipe management, simpli-
fying the cooking process for users, and enhancing their overall cooking experience.

3 Target Users

Around 23 million people across Australia, U.S, Canada, and India have asked Google for the food recipe
and cooking mobile app, proving an ongoing demand. Recipe plays an important role to prepare delicious
and quality-consistent food, which is crucial for family dinners and even restaurant settings. The scattered
existence of recipes on the Internet creates diﬃculties for users, so a recipe management system would
be an ideal solution. Understanding such a need, our product is created to serve:

Regular Individual Users

• Our application is a public platform where recipes are freely shared among users, so it is more

suitable for individuals than corporations or businesses

• Fitness fanatics: healthy meal plans, calorie consumption tracking

• Travelers: easy and quick cooking with on-site ingredients

• Home cooks: step-by-step directions to make food like experts or food for a vegan diet, grocery

shopping feature

Professionals

• Log, store, and organize personal recipes like a private cookbook

• Greatly improve quality consistency

• Keeping up with culinary trends

• Eﬀective inventory management

• Can be improved to be used in restaurant chains or businesses

4 Functional Speciﬁcation

As this product is designed to be able to handle large amounts recipes, it will be suitable for anything
from personal use to professional environments, where it is required to manage a comprehensive amount
of recipes. This makes it perfect for home users, restaurants, and kitchens of any size. The simple design
of the product also allows new users to pick up and use quickly with little to no training, which makes it
suitable to use for most people.

Function/features:

Recipe and ingredient management

• Users will be able to create, edit, view and delete recipes and ingredients locally on their system.

• Recipes could include name, description, ingredients, steps, pictures, nutritional value, time to cook,

and other additional information

• Ingredients could include name, description, price, measuring unit, pictures, nutritional value and

other additional information

Recipe and ingredient organization

• Recipes will be stored and displayed using a folder tree structure, where users can organize their
 recipes into diﬀerent folders and sub folders, allowing easy navigation and viewing for large amounts
 of recipes.

• Recipes and ingredients can be tagged in order to achieve further organization. Tags are independent

of folders and adds another layer of organization for easy management of large amounts of recipes.

While searching for recipes, tags can be used to ﬁlter out unwanted results, or look for recipes with
certain tags.

• Tags could include but not limited to: favorite, vegan, non vegan. These tags can be added by the

user, or automatically added by the program based on certain conditions.

Search and Filtering

• Recipes and ingredients could be searched using name, folder path, or details Unwanted recipes and

ingredients can be ﬁltered out using tags.

• More advanced searches could ﬁlter entries that only ﬁt certain conditional expressions (for example,

recipes that cost lower than $5)

Meal planning

• Users can plan their meals ahead on a built in calender in the program

• The program may be able to give suggestions based on the nutritional values entered, price, time

to cook and other details which can be based on a user’s personal preference

• The program can give a summary of a meal based on the selected recipes or a day on the meal

planner.

• The summary gives information such as price, average or maximum cooking time, ingredients

required, and other useful information

Other features

• The number of portions or servings can be set, and the program will automatically calculate the

new amount of required ingredients based on the original amount of ingredients required

• The program will be able to convert units from diﬀerent systems of measurement automatically

based on the information that has been given
