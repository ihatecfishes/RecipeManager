2 Product Description
The purpose of this product is to provide a comprehensive platform for recipe management, making it
easier for users to organize their recipes, access them from any device, and discover new ones from a vast
collection of recipes. The objectives of this product are to streamline the recipe management process,
save time and effort in meal planning, and improve the cooking experience for users.
Our product is an application coded in Java, making it compatible with various operating systems. It
will provide users with a user-friendly interface that allows them to store, categorize, and search their
recipes efficiently. Additionally, users will be able to explore new recipes from an extensive database,
save their favorites, and create customized shopping lists based on the ingredients required for selected
recipes. Users will also be able to filter recipes suitable with their diet (vegan, meat, dairy, etc..), stick
with their diet better with the meal planner option, or provided with precisely convenient calculations in
portion setting with the exact amount of ingredients (gram, cups, etc..) in both shopping and cooking
process.
The problem that our product aims to solve is the hassle of organizing and managing a collection of recipes.
Many people find it challenging to keep track of their recipes, which often results in lost or misplaced
recipes, difficulty in meal planning, and inefficiency in grocery shopping. Our recipe management system
will provide users with a one-stop-shop for all their recipe needs, allowing them to access their recipes
from any device, search for new recipes, and create a shopping list based on the ingredients required.
